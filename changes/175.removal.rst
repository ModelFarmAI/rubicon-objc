Removed the ``rubicon.objc.core_foundation`` module. This was an internal module with few remaining contents and should
not have any external uses. If you need to call Core Foundation functions in your code, please load the framework
yourself using ``load_library('CoreFoundation')`` and define the types and functions that you need.
