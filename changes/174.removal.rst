Tightened the API of :func:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.send_message`,
removing some previously allowed shortcuts that were rarely used,
or likely to be used by accident in an unsafe way.

.. note::

    In most cases,
    Rubicon's high-level method call syntax provided by :class:`~rubicon.objc.api.ObjCInstance` can be used instead of :func:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.send_message`.
    This syntax is almost always more convenient to use, more readable and less error-prone.
    :func:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.send_message` should only be used in cases not supported by the high-level syntax.

* Disallowed passing class names as :class:`str`/:class:`bytes` as the ``receiver`` argument of :func:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.send_message`.
  If you need to send a message to a class object (i. e. call a class method),
  use :class:`~rubicon.objc.api.ObjCClass` or :func:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.get_class` to look up the class,
  and pass the resulting :class:`~rubicon.objc.api.ObjCClass` or :class:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.Class` object as the receiver.
* Disallowed passing :class:`~ctypes.c_void_p` objects as the ``receiver`` argument of :func:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.send_message`.
  The ``receiver`` argument now has to be of type :class:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.objc_id`,
  or one of its subclasses (such as :class:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.Class`),
  or one of its high-level equivalents (such as :class:`~rubicon.objc.api.ObjCInstance`).
  This is the case for all Objective-C objects returned by Rubicon's high-level and low-level APIs.
  If you need to send a message to an object pointer stored as :class:`~ctypes.c_void_p`,
  :func:`~ctypes.cast` it to :class:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.objc_id` first.
* Removed default values for :func:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.send_message`'s ``restype`` and ``argtypes`` keyword arguments.
  Every :func:`~rubicon.objc.runtime.send_message` call now needs to have its return and argument types set explicitly.
  This ensures that all arguments and the return value are converted correctly between (Objective-)C and Python.
