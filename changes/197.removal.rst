Removed macOS 10.12 through 10.14 from our automatic test matrix,
due to pricing changes in one of our CI services (Travis CI).
OS X 10.11 is still included in the test matrix for now,
but will probably be removed relatively soon.
Automatic tests on macOS 10.15 and 11.0 are unaffected
as they run on a different CI service (GitHub Actions).

Rubicon will continue to support macOS 10.14 and earlier on a best-effort
basis, even though compatibility is no longer tested automatically.
If you encounter any bugs or other problems with Rubicon on these older macOS
versions, please report them!
