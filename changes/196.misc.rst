Replaced regex-based version extraction code in setup.py with
``version = attr: ...`` in setup.cfg, now that setuptools (since
`version 46.4.0 <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#v46-4-0>`__)
supports extracting ``attr: ...`` values statically where possible without
having to import the module in question at runtime.
