Removed automatic conversion of Objective-C numbers (``NSNumber`` and
``NSDecimalNumber``) to Python numbers when received from Objective-C
(i. e. returned from an Objective-C method or property or passed into an
Objective-C method implemented in Python). This automatic conversion
significantly slowed down every Objective-C method call that returns an object,
even though the conversion doesn't apply to most method calls. If you have code
that receives an Objective-C number and needs to use it as a Python number,
please convert it explicitly using :func:`~rubicon.objc.api.py_from_ns` or an
appropriate Objective-C method.
