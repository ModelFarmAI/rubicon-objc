Introduced GitHub Actions workflows for CI and release automation.
GitHub Actions is now used to test on macOS 10.15,
and Travis CI is used to test on older macOS versions.
To shorten CI build times,
the full range of supported Python versions is now only tested on macOS 10.15 with GitHub Actions.
The older macOS versions on Travis CI only run the tests on the oldest supported version (currently 3.5).
