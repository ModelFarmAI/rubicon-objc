    # Note: The ordering of the environments is optimized so that the complete matrix runs as quickly as possible,
    # while also providing the first results as early as possible.
    # At the moment, build times for each environment are roughly as follows:
    # xcode7.3: 16 minutes
    # xcode8.3: 7 minutes
    # xcode9.2: 7 minutes
    # xcode10.1: 6 minutes
    # https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/osx/#macos-version
    # This data is based on the following build, which should be similar to most builds on the repo:
    # https://travis-ci.org/pybee/rubicon-objc/builds/506412489
    # Currently, Travis allows a maximum of two concurrent Mac builds per owner:
    # https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-09-22-macos-update
    # With the following order, xcode7.3 will take up the first slot, and at the same time the three other
    # environments use the second slot in sequence. xcode10.1 will finish first and provide some early results - most
    # test failures happen in all environments and will be quickly reported this way.
